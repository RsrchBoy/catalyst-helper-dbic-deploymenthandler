=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a Catalyst helper module that builds a
L<DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler> script for you.

VERY EARLY CODE: things may yet change, but shouldn't impact older versions
(unless you regenerate the script).

Schemas not named MyApp::DB::Schema.

Determine the db type automatically

L<DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler>, L<DBIx::Class>,
L<DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler::Manual::CatalystIntro>

=head1 CODE LINEAGE

While I put together this helper module, this code is largely based on the
information (and code) in
L<DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler::Manual::CatalystIntro>.  Any errors are mine.
